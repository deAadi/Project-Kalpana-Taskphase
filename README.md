1️⃣ LED Brightness Control with Button (3 Levels)

Use a single push-button to cycle an LED through three brightness levels: low, medium, and high. Each button press increases the brightness; after reaching the highest level, it cycles back to low. This is achieved using PWM (analogWrite) and a state counter.



2️⃣ 4-Bit Up Counter Using LEDs

Implement a 4-bit binary counter using 4 LEDs connected to digital pins. The counter increases from 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111 in binary). Each count update changes the LED states to represent the current number in binary



3️⃣ 7-Segment Display Counter (1 to 40 and Back)

Create a counter that displays numbers from 1 to 40 on a 7-segment display (or two displays). After reaching 40, the count resets to 1
